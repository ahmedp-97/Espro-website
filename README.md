# Pillows-website

For making this site I used Visual Studio Code.
Project icluded HTML CSS and JavaScript

This task was really fun and exciting , I really learned some new things specially with css positioning everything to look as same as original page. 
I had issues with positioning everything to be like original page, but like I said I learned a lot from it and it was fun learning process. 
Overall it took me 6 days to complete, about 5 hours per day, half of my day I was working at my job, then after I came home I would continue. 
It would take half time less if I had whole days free, but I think I managed my time well to finish this task at time.
